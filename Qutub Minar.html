            <p class="page-content"><b>The Qutub Minar</b> Complex was Built in the early 13th century a few kilometres south of Delhi, the red 
                sandstone tower of Qutb Minar is 72.5 m high, tapering from 2.75 m in diameter at its peak to 14.32 m at its base, and alternating 
                angular and rounded flutings. The surrounding archaeological area contains funerary buildings, notably the magnificent Alai-Darwaza 
                Gate, the masterpiece of Indo-Muslim art (built in 1311), and two mosques, including the Quwwatu'l-Islam, the oldest in northern India, 
                built of materials reused from some 20 Brahman temples.</p>

            <p class="page-content">The ensemble of mosques, minars, and other structures in the <i>Qutb Minar</i> complex is an outstanding testimony to the 
                architectural and artistic achievements of Islamic rulers after they first established their power in the Indian subcontinent in the 12th century. 
                The complex, located at the southern fringe of New Delhi, illustrates the new rulers’ aspiration to transform India from <b>Dar-al-Harb </b>
                to <b>Dar-al-Islam</b> with the introduction of distinctive building types and forms.</p>
           
            <p class="page-content">
                Referred to as the Qutb mosque, the <i>Quwwatu’l-Islam</i>, meaning the Might of Islam, introduced to India the classic model of 
                Islamic architecture that had developed in western Asia. The mosque constituted a large rectangular courtyard enclosed by arcades 
                having carved pillars on three sides and an imposing five-arched screen marking the west. Incorporating temple elements such as the 
                carved pillars and cladding characteristic of Hindu and Jain temples, it was completed by subsequent rulers – Qutb ud din Aibak and 
                <i>Shamsu’d-Din Iltutmish</i>. Drawing references from their Ghurid homeland, they constructed a minar (minaret) at the south-eastern 
                corner of the Quwwatu’l-Islam between 1199 and 1503, thereby completing the vocabulary of a typical classic Islamic mosque. 
                Built of red and buff sandstone and eloquently carved with inscriptional bands, the Qutb Minar is the tallest masonry tower in India, 
                measuring 72.5 metres high, with projecting balconies for calling all Muadhdhin to prayer. An iron pillar in the courtyard gave the 
                mosque a unique Indian aesthetic..

            <p class="page-content">
                The 13th-century square tomb of Iltutmish in the north-western part of <i>Quwwatu’l-Islam</i> marks the beginning of the tradition of constructing 
                royal tombs, a practice followed as late as the Mughal era in India. The tomb-chamber is profusely carved with inscriptions and geometrical 
                and arabesque patterns associated with Saracenic tradition. Expansions made by Allaudin Khilji to the existing ensemble between 1296 and 1311 
                reflect the power wielded by the monarch. In his short reign, the emperor added a massive ceremonial gateway (Alai Darwaza) south of the 
                Qutb Minar, and also added a madarsa (place of learning). The first storey of the incomplete Alai Minar, which was envisaged to be twice 
                the scale of the Qutb Minar, stands 25 metres high.</p>
